# Reverse String - Notes

## Approach
used flow of control (if statements) and the modulus operator 

## Challenges
not too challenging, familiar with the concepts 

## Testing
use test cases provided by exercism

## Potential Improvements
I improved this method by looking at community solutions and realizing that there was a shorter way to test for not divisible by 3,5, and 7. 

## Reflection
I enjoyed this problem and learned that its best to try to find the simpliest test case for something that you can identify
