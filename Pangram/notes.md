# Pangram - Notes

## Approach
Used set method to determine is one set was a superset of the other

## Challenges
My first thought was to do if 'a' in string and 'b' in string etc for the whole alphabet and knew that was clunky and had to think of a simplier way to write it

## Testing
use test cases provided by exercism

## Potential Improvements 
I looked at community soltuions and was happy with the way I wrote mine, dont think it needs to be improved

## Reflection
For this one I talked with chatGPT and asked it not to tell me the answer and just to verify my thinking and this was helpful. To improve code telling chatGPT to not give the solution but just talk with it like a teacher is helpful to learn. I will continue to do this to help improve my logic and instincts
