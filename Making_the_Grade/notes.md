# Making the Grade - Notes

## Approach
Used for loops to cycle through and modify data

## Challenges
I was not familiar with looping in python or the enumerate() method, I had to learn how to use these

## Testing
Tested with test cases provided by exercism

## Potential Improvements
Other community solutions wrote more concise code, could try to make code simplier for future solutions

## Reflection
Learned how to use for loops and enumerate() as well as that enumerate() is perferred when looping becuase it clearly shows that you are going to be cycling through the data in the iterable. I learned that if you are using enumerate() and wont be using either the index or item variable, you can use a _ to indicate that variable should be ignored: for index, _ in enumerate(student_scores)
