# Bob - Notes

## Approach
used if statements and string methods to return different strings based on input


## Challenges
at first didnt clean up the string to remove leading and trailing whitespace so some of the tests failed

## Testing
used test cases provided by exercism

## Potential Improvements
think about cleaning input right away when passed as an argument

## Reflection
learned more about string methods (leanred isupper()) and leanred the importance of cleaning a string up before working with it
