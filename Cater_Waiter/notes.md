# Cater Waiter - Notes

## Approach
Used set methods to modify sets

## Challenges
This exercise was more challenging because I had to learn about sets for the first time. 

## Testing
Used test cases provided by exercism

## Potential Improvements
After looking at community solutions, I improved one of my functions by using unpacking with the union() method for sets. 

## Reflection
I learned about set methods and made improvements to my code which was good. I learned that the union() method for sets can take a list of sets as an argument if you use unpacking. Also learned that if you do set.union() this will create and empty set and add whatever you put in for the argument.
