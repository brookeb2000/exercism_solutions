# Darts - Notes

## Approach
use if statements to determine the score a dart should recieve based on its x,y coordinates

## Challenges
had to remember the formula for the equation of a circle which was a bit rusty

## Testing
use test cases provided by exercism

## Potential Improvements
looked at community solutions and many calculated the distance from the center of the circle to the x,y point and then compared to the radii, but I think my way of using the equation of a circle is good as well, dont need to change it

## Reflection
Enjoyed this problem, was just problem solving, no new python to learn
