# Mecha Munch Management - Notes

## Approach
used various dict methods to modify data in dicts

## Challenges
rembering how to change values in a dict was a bit of a challenge. Using <dict>.get() was very helpful to get the current value and then set a default return if the key was not present. This helped me to update existing keys by 1 easily when give a list of data to go through to add to the dict. Other challenges was figuring out how to unpack the data when given an iterable of pairs (x,y). I learned that you can simply do for x, y in iterable

## Testing
used test cases provided by exercism

## Potential Improvements
After looking at community solutions, I improved one of the methods my using the update() function. 


## Reflection
This exercise was more challenging and I need to just keep practicing to get more comfortable with the dict methods.
