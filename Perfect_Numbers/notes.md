# Perfect Numbers - Notes

## Approach
Used expection raising to ensure user inputs correct argument type. Used if statement to control the flow of the program.

## Challenges
Learning how to raise errors was something new. I learned that you must do error handling yourself within functions that you write, and that when you raise an error is creates an error object that is passed in the call stack until it gets resolved, if not the program ends.

## Testing
use test cases provided by exercism

## Potential Improvements
After looking at community solutions to this exercise, I did it the way most people did, dont need to imrpove the approach I think. 

## Reflection
It was good to learn about exception handling and how that actually works on the call stack.
