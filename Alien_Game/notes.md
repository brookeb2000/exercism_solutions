# Alien Game - Notes

## Approach
Used class methods and init() to create a class

## Challenges
This was my first time learning classes in python and it was challenging to get the concepts at firts because its very different from C++. In python there are class attributes which all instances share and instance attributes which belong to each individual instance. 

## Testing
Used test cases provided by exercism

## Potential Improvements
After looking at community solutions, I improved my is_alive() method by just putting the boolean expression before the return.

## Reflection
I'm happy I'm learning this now ahead of my python class to be prepared. I like how classes are structured in python better than C++.
