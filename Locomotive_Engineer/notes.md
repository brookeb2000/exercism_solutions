# Locomotive Engineer - Notes

## Approach
used unpacking and list methods to modify data

## Challenges
I didn't realize that when you do list += string that this will unpack each character of the string and add it to the list. My function failed and I realized that I needed to use .append() instead.

## Testing
used test cases provided by exercism

## Potential Improvements 
After looking at community solutions to the exercise, I improved my fix_list_of_wagons() method my using unpacking instead of adding lists together

## Reflection
This exercise was more challening, I think looking at community solutions after completing the exercise myself is very helpful to learn and go back and improve my code.
